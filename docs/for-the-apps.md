# Answers for the apps session

What was asked for in `docs/for-the-website-worlds.md`, and what the website
now does about it. Everything here is on `main` and the migrations are
`0080`, `0081` and `0082`.

## 1. Models are a Marketplace kind

`assets.kind` always had `model`, and the Create pages always drew it. What
stopped a `.kbfl` reaching the bucket was its type: Kobblon's own part file
is JSON under a name no browser has a type for, so it arrived with an empty
one and the `uploads` bucket refused it.

- `application/json` and `text/plain` are allowed on that bucket now.
- The uploader labels a `.kbfl` as `application/json` rather than sending
  nothing, and offers `.kbfl` in its file picker.
- The content code is `MDL-`, which the tile map already said.

Nothing parses the file. It is user content, it is screened like any other
upload, and the runtime that reads it is the thing that refuses what it
cannot make sense of.

## 2. The emblem and the thumbnails

Agreed, and built the way you described it.

- **The emblem is `worlds.cover_url`.** It is set through
  `configure_world(which, …, cover => '<world id>/emblem-….png')`. The
  argument is a path inside that World's own folder, checked against the
  World's id; an address on another host is refused. What is stored is the
  full Kobblon address, built from `storage_base()`.
- **Thumbnails are `world_media`**: `(id, world_id, position, kind, path,
  created_at)`, `kind` in `('image', 'video')`, `path` a path in the
  `worlds` bucket with no spaces and no `..`, at most twelve per World,
  enforced by a trigger. Row level security reads through to the World:
  anybody may see the media of a World they can see, only the owner writes.

Neither goes anywhere near `assets`, and neither gets a content id.

## 3. The World icon

`faEarthEurope`, exported as `worldIcon` from `src/lib/naming.ts`, so it is
one import rather than a decision taken again in every file.

## 4. configure_world and the genres

```
configure_world(
  which    uuid,
  called   text default null,   -- name
  about    text default null,   -- description
  genre    text default null,   -- an id from world_genres
  maturity text default null,   -- everyone | mild | moderate | strong
  cover    text default null    -- '<world id>/…' , or '' to take it off
) returns public.worlds
```

Null means leave it alone, so a client that knows about three of these
fields does not wipe the rest by not knowing them. It raises on a genre that
is not a genre, on an emblem outside the World's folder, and on somebody
else's World. Publishing is deliberately **not** in it: `publish_world` has
its own rules, and a name change should not be the same action as putting a
World in front of people.

The genres are rows in `world_genres`, read with `world_genre_list()` by
anybody signed in or not:

    adventure, obby, roleplay, simulator, tycoon, fighting, shooter,
    racing, puzzle, horror, survival, sports, building, social, showcase,
    other

Read the list, do not hardcode it. If one is missing, say so and it is one
insert.

## 5. The sign in code

- **Ten minutes**, since `0079`. The two minutes were wrong and a cold start
  measured at 55 seconds proves it.
- **An account with no email** no longer fails silently. `claim_app_code`
  returns `(user_id, email, is_guest)`, and the sign in function answers
  "Finish your Kobblon account on the website first" for a guest and "that
  account has no email address on it" otherwise, rather than claiming the
  link expired. It had not expired; it was never going to work.

A guest genuinely cannot sign in to an application: there are no credentials
to hand over. That is a thing to say plainly in the app, not a thing to work
around.

## What the engine gained at the same time

- A decal keeps its own proportions. `scale` stretches it on purpose,
  `offset` slides it across the face in face widths, and its material is its
  own, so a blue half see through wall does not tint the picture on it.
- Wheel zoom, between the engine's near end and `camera.zoom.most` from the
  manifest. At the near end K6 is not drawn at all.
- Sound: `manifest.sounds` for ambience, a `WorldSound` child of a part for
  something with a position, and loaded kept apart from playing so a script
  can answer the second question later. `SoundService` is exported.
- `WorldDecal` and `WorldSound` are on the export line in
  `src/engine/index.ts`.

## Still open

- **Collision.** Every shape still collides as its bounding box, so a wedge
  is not a ramp and nothing is anchored. A rigid body solver is the one
  decision that fixes both. Waiting on Staw.
- **Migrations `0080` to `0082` and the `app-signin` function** have to be
  applied and deployed before any of the above answers in production.
